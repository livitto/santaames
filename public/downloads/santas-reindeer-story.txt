Santa's Reindeer
SANTA AMES

Everyone knows the story about Rudolph, well some of the story at least. Now you will learn the rest of the story. I'm sure that everyone has seen the movie about Rudolph, but there is a problem with that. That movie was made sooo very long ago, over 50 years. In fact, mom and dad weren't even born yet! Well Rudolph is not small like that anymore. He is all grown up and as big as the rest of the reindeer.

Now who remembers the name of Rudolph's very special friend in the movie? Not the little boy or any of the misfits toys. It was Clarice, the little girl reindeer.

Of course she is grown up also. In fact this past season Rudolph and Clarice had 2 babies, a little boy and a little girl. That's right Rudi is a daddy now!

I know you have many questions. No, neither of the calves have a red nose. Only Rudolph has a red nose. No, we haven't named them yet. Santa knows that when you were born, maybe even before, mom and dad had picked out a name for you. The elves always wait till the babies get a little older. Then they get named based on the kind of reindeer they are.

That's how Blitzen got his name. Blitzen means lightning and he is Santa's fastest reindeer. Donder's name means thunder, and he is Santa's strongest reindeer. So whenever they are on a sleigh, the sleigh is being pulled by thunder and lightning.

Now here is where Santa needs your help. When you write Santa to tell him what you would like for Christmas, Santa would like for you to add some name selections for the new reindeer. Santa will need a boy's and a girl's name. You never know, you might just have gotten to name one of Rudi's kids!
