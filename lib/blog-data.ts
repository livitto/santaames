    excerpt: "How it all started - from my father's 32 years as Santa to my first magical moment at K-Mart",
    content: `I started this journey quite a few years ago, after my father put on the suit for 32 years. He was the chef at Wakonda Club in Des Moines and the manager gave him the suit for him to come to the kid's Christmas party at the club. So he did that and visited 4 families for all 32 years. He saw generations grow up. My former sister-in-law worked for General Growth. She commented that I should put the suit on. So I gave it a try. 

My very first event was a walk around at K-Mart. My wife dropped me off back from the door. As I walked up, I heard SANTA, SANTA. As I looked around for the source and saw a young gal, about 4, pulling her dad across the parking lot. When she got to the sidewalk she broke free and she did a 50 yard dash to me. Thankfully I got down on one knee because as I opened my arms to her, she ran into them and almost knocked me over. She said, "I love you Santa". 

A warm feeling came over me, like something I never felt before. I said to myself, I want to do this the rest of my life. And as they say in movies, the rest is history.`,

      "Magical mishaps and hilarious moments from decades of being Santa - including a young girl's wish for a magic wand",
    content: `After many years of wearing the red suit, I have many stories. There are the good, the bad and the ugly. One story I love to tell goes back many years when I was visiting a mall in Torrance, CA. Just being at this mall is a story in itself. The courtyard the set was in had been the site of a fight between the Bloods and Crips many years ago. I think had I known that, I may have decided not to go there. But I digress.

Back to my story. This set had a large foam bag next to the chair, that I imagine was used to put the little treats Santa would hand out, but now was a spot that children would put their Letters to Santa. Usually, the children would hand them directly to me. One day this young gal came with letter in hand in a sealed envelope and dropped it in the bag. I asked if we should read it now, and she said "not till you get back to the North Pole" as she came to sit on my lap. Asked her if she wanted to give me any hints as to what was in the letter…NOPE. After much discussion and prodding, she mentioned she wanted a magic wand. Time frame of the first of the Harry Potter movies coming out.

I said a real one? YES. Oh my, that's not possible since to have a real magic wand you would need to be taught how to use it. Asked if a toy wand would be ok, if I could find one? YES and with that she left. A couple of days later I was going through the letters in the bag and found a sealed envelope with DO NOT OPEN TILL BACK AT THE NORTH POLE. I knew exactly who this was from. I opened the envelope, and the first line was "For Christmas, I want a magic wand so that I can turn my mom into a pig." I completely lost it I was laughing so hard. I wish I could have been the fly on the wall to see what brought this up. No wonder, she didn't want me reading when she was there. Mom was just a few feet away.

A couple of years later, I had 2 young boys about 4 and 6 come visit. The younger boy said he wanted a magic wand for Christmas. It was all I could do to not laugh. I asked why he wanted a magic wand. He said that he wanted to make his brother small since his snoring kept him awake.`,
